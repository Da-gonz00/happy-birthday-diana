            <p><strong>Honestly Diana, I am so damn glad you are someone I stayed in contact with after High school. You are an amazing friend (or as you like to say acquaintance but maybe it's more like pen pals since we never see each other LMAO)</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Like I was saying, you're an amazing friend and I am glad you're a part of my life. I know I'm usually bullying you or making jokes at you but it's your birthday so it's time I be honest.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>You are one of the smartest, funniest, and down right one of the most caring people I know. You have this warm feeling that radiates from you, even when you're being mean. Also I don't know if I've ever said this in the past but I hope you know, you're very pretty. </strong></p>
            <p><strong>In our friendship I have never felt like I had to act like someone I'm not, in fact you are probably someone who knows me best of all. I hope you continue to stay a part of my life and I hope you know how amazing you really are.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Anyway I knew you wouldn't let me take you out for your birthday so I hope this is an okay birthday gift.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>A website just for you that will never go down.</strong></p>
